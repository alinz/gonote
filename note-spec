Note
Note is a new way of structure data which closes to human brain.
It supports 2 types of values.

  1: Simple
    Number
    String - empty string considers null
    null
    true | false
    import: !!

  2: Complex
    Map
      except : and -, anything can be consider as key.
    Array

This data structure is indented.

Here are some examples

#Map of array

names:
  - John
  - Mary
  - etc
Locations:
  - NYC
  - LA

#Map of Map

Locations:
  country: USA
  city: NYC

# Map of constants

PI: 3.14
counter: 1
isAccessable: false

# string can be splited into multiple lines as long as the first line doesn't have
# colean or starts with (- + space)

message:
  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
  to make a type specimen book.
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
  into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
  software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
